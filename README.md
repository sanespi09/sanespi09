# HI üëãüèº WELCOME!
## I'M SANTIAGO ESPINA, SOFTWARE ENGINEER

### ABOUT ME
Since childhood I have had a profound affinity with technology,  
I was always interested in knowing how I could expand the possibilities of computers and amazed at their capabilities.  
As a teenager I had my first acquaintances with the world of programming,  
making small video games in Adobe Flash. üöÄ‚ò†Ô∏è

After a three years academic studies in Computer Science back in 2013,  
and getting a B.S as a Sound Engineer in 2019.      
I've decided to put all my energy towards this technological inclination.  
In late 2019 entered the world of web development, in a front-end oriented beginning,  
taking advantage of my previous experiences with graphic design.  

As I refined my skills in the area,   
I began to feel attracted to what was happening behind the scenes,  
so, in the beginnings of 2021 I decided to study back-end technologies  
to get a better grasp about this vast area.

In the present time, I'm focused on the React ecosystem,  
Developing proyects and studying everything I can about it.  

Broadly speaking, I consider myself a very creative, analytical, proactive and persevering and  person.
